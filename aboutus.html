			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Welcome to SMRT!</p>
			<p>
			<br>SMRT is a disruptive car renting platform that makes it possible to rent a car without paying any brokerage.</p>
<br>
<p>SMRT was started because all of us believed that paying hefty brokerage can not be the only option to rent a car. As a user, we have been paying these brokerages year on year without seeing any advantage of the broker. The only reason he existed was that there was a huge information asymmetry in the market. SMRT is a platform that removes this information asymmetry and provides a marketplace for free exchange of this information that used to cost 1-2 months to rent a car.</p>

<br><p>We have done 2 things to help you find that perfect car:</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <br><li>Firstly, we have painstakingly verified each listing and made sure that these are direct owners or shared accommodation parties and there are no middlemen or brokers. We use lot of heuristics and techniques to ensure that you get a totally broker free list.</li>

    <br><li>Secondly, we have also tried to ensure that maximum information is available to you in as easy to use format. This ensures that you get a very good idea of the car even before you see it. Thus, you can shortlist cars sitting at the comfort of your home without actually traveling all the good and bad agencies. This saves your time and effort and with a quick shortlist of 4-5 cars you can actually get a car in few minutes!</li>
</ul>
<br><p>If you are a Owner interested in posting your cars to SMRT, please email us at hello@SMRT.in and we will get in touch to help you list the car.</p>

<br><br><u><p align="center">And users, happy hunting and get in touch with us to let us know how else we can help!</p></u>
